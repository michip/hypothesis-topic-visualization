            <h2 id="legal-structure">Legal Structure</h2>
            <p>The Max Planck Society is a non-profit research facility which is organized as a registered association.
                All
                of
                the institutes and facilities of the Max Planck Society are largely autonomous in terms of organization
                and
                research, but as a rule have no legal capacity of their own.</p>
            <h2 id="foreign-language-pages">Foreign Language Pages</h2>
            <p>To the extent that parts of this Internet site are offered in languages other than German, this
                represents a
                service exclusively for staff and guests of the Max Planck Society who are not proficient in German.</p>
            <h2 id="liability-for-contents-of-online-information">Liability for Contents of Online Information</h2>
            <p>As the provider of contents in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Tele-Media Law, the Max
                Planck
                Society shall be responsible for any contents which it makes available for use in accordance with
                general
                legal
                provisions. The Max Planck Society makes every effort to provide timely and accurate information on this
                Website. Nevertheless, errors and inaccuracies cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the Max Planck
                Society
                does not assume any liability for the relevance, accuracy, completeness or quality of the information
                provided.
                The Max Planck Society shall not be liable for damage of a tangible or intangible nature caused directly
                or
                indirectly through the use or failure to use the information offered and/or through the use of faulty or
                incomplete information unless it is verifiably culpable of intent or gross negligence. The same shall
                apply
                to
                any downloadable software available free of charge. The Max Planck Society reserves the right to modify,
                supplement, or delete any or all of the information offered on its Internet site, or to temporarily or
                permanently cease publication thereof without prior and separate notification.</p>
            <h2 id="links-to-internet-sites-of-third-parties">Links to Internet Sites of Third Parties</h2>
            <p>This Internet site includes links to external pages. These external links are designated as follows:
                <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt  pr-1 fa-fw"></i>.
                The respective provider shall be responsible for the contents of any linked external pages. However, a
                constant
                review of linked external pages is unreasonable without concrete reason to believe that a violation of
                the
                law
                may be involved. If the Max Planck Society determines such or it is pointed out by others that an
                external
                offer
                to which it is connected via a link entails civil or criminal responsibility, then the Max Planck
                Society
                will
                immediately eliminate any link to this offer. The Max Planck Society expressly dissociates itself from
                such
                contents.</p>
